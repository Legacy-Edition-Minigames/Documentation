Installing the Map Editor
=========================

To be able to add map data for ModTools (spawnpoints, borders, chests, etc) you must install the Editor DataPack first.

Before installing to a world, you must download the editor from `GitHub <https://github.com/Legacy-Edition-Minigames/ModTools/releases/latest>`_

.. important::
    Make sure you are on Minecraft ``1.20`` or ``1.20.1`` before proceeding.

Make sure to download the file named ``ModTools-Editor`` and not ``Source Code``
