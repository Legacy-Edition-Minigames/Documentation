Creating a custompack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As a base for your pack it is recommended to start with the `all-music pack <https://github.com/Legacy-Edition-Minigames/Minigame-Resources/releases/latest/download/all-music.zip>`_
this will allow the pack to play music in maps, rather than play silence. If you are creating a custompack for a system with OpenGL issues, or are using a launcher that replaced OpenGL (such as Pojav Launcher) you may need to base the pack off of the `all-music no shaders pack <https://github.com/Legacy-Edition-Minigames/Minigame-Resources/releases/latest/download/all-music-no-shaders.zip>`_ .

If you do not know how to install a resource pack you can find a guide on `Planet Minecraft <https://www.planetminecraft.com/blog/how-to-install-a-resource-pack/>`_

If you are looking for specific assets to change out, you can find a list of commonly changed assets at the :doc:`/custompack/commonassets` doc.
