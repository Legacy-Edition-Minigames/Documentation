Creating a custompack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As a base for your pack it is recommended to start with the ``all-music pack <https://github.com/Legacy-Edition-Minigames/Minigame-Resources/releases/latest/download/all-music.zip>``_
this will allow the pack to play music in maps, rather than play silence.

If you do not know how to install a resource pack you can find a guide on ``Planet Minecraft <https://www.planetminecraft.com/blog/how-to-install-a-resource-pack/>``_

If you are looking for specific assets to change out, you can find a list of commonly changed assets at the :doc:`/custompack/commonassets` doc.
