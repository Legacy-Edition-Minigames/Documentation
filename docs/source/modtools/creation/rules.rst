Rules
-----
1. All content must meet a quality bar.
    * *If* the map is adapted from another map, written permission must be obtained by the original creator before it can be accepted.
    * Custom maps cannot give unfair advantages, (in combat or otherwise) to any player.
    * "Shitpost" maps are allowed, as long as they are of a decent quality and feel complete without major issues.
2. No NSFW / Sexual Content, symbols, builds, textures & sounds. 
    * Maps taking place in "Untasteful" settings/relations to real world events such as: Nazi Germany, 9/11, Hiroshima, and any other depictions of similar events are forbidden.
      If there are any questions related to this, please ask a moderator about the related topic.
3. Malicious Content is prohibited
    * Scripts, files, code, materials, or anything able to do harm to the host server, players, or backend tools.
      including but not limited to: Crashing players or servers, "Breakout" or modifying anything outside of your map to change things in other maps, 
      player lockouts/soft locks, scripts that "hijack" aspects of the server or clients, or loops designed to use significantly above average resource usage without need.
4. Battle maps must be no larger than 25 MB when compiled.
    * This limitation is intended to maintain server stability when loading a map, and preserve storage space for new maps to be added.
    * Tumble and Glide Maps do not apply to this limit, and size restrictions will be reevaluated when they are available.
    * Custom resource packs are not included in this limit, but will be reevaluated once available.
5. Maps must meet the minimum defined requirements in :doc:`/modtools/uploading/requirements`
    * If these requirements are not meet the server will be unable to load the map properly
